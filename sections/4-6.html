The process of cremation is also used for different reasons.</p></div>

Having so many benefits surrounding them, such as the lack of diseases and the 'joys' of physical pleasure playing a major role in their everyday lives, there really wouldn't be much of a reason for any of them to be upset. The same could not be said for two particular individuals: Bernard Marx and Helmholtz Watson. In terms of objectivity and with what they have, as well as their appearances, they both act as the other's foil. However, when looking at their mindsets, eerily similar appearances tend to pop up. Within the story, Bernard makes known his dissatisfaction of the society that he lives in and how everything revolves around drugs and sex, wishing for something more. Helmholtz, while having been given everything from money to power to women, expresses a sort of emptiness at how easy his life had been, and that he desires for a more interesting situation to occur. As he states, "Did you ever feel... as though you had something inside you that was only waiting for you to give it a chance to come out?" (Huxley 72). The two are similar in that they both have a feeling of emptiness within their hearts concerning their current lives, an emotion rarely felt by anyone who lives within the 'Brave New World'</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;Likewise, in a way, they are somewhat similar to the people of the real world. When a person gets a job a stable job with plenty of pay, they've become set for life. However, are they truly happy with their line of work? Would they be satisfied with working in an unbearable job, regardless of how high the pay is? These feelings eat them up inside and always make themselves known as feelings of emptiness and wanting something more to happen. Such emotions can be prime reasons as to why a person would quit his/her job so readily so as to embark on some sort of self-discovery journey. That is, perhaps, the main difference between the U.S. today and the 'Brave New World.' Whereas people in the U.S. can understand their own feelings and utilize them to fuel their actions, the unsatisfied duo of Aldous Huxley's world cannot understand their own feelings, as well as being unable to act on them.</p></div>

Happiness is soma, if you are having a bad day or just not feeling your 100%, take soma and enter a world of happiness and great thoughts. Don't just take Soma alone! Having an Orgy Porgy?
