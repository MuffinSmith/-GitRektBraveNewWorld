					    	<p>&emsp;&emsp;A drug called soma is introduced in these three chapters. In small doses, it can make one happy, larger doses make one live in a blissful state where one is unaware of their surroundings for weeks. In the united states of america, we have  similar drugs which can make one feel similar effects. The overall purpose of the drug in Brave New World is to stop them from attempting to overthrow the government or to prevent them from pursuing knowledge, so they remain happy and ignorant. Another technology developed is the process of decanting. In the book, there is no such thing as viviparous reproduction, and instead, is called decanting. This process shapes the embryo into the type of person it will grow up to be. In the decanting room, intelligence is manipulated from the five classes; Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon. In addition, their future careers are planned out ahead of time by conditioning the embryos so that they are accustomed to what their career will entail. In today's world, we do not see manipulation the way described in the book however, at a very young age, babies and toddlers' brains are rapidly growing and the influence of technology can greatly change the how they do in school and in life.  I believe that new technology is just like any other technology. For instance, the knife, created with the purpose of making cooking and eating easier can also used to harm people. The technology is not the problem; it is the type of people who use it for the wrong purpose.</p>
					    	<p>&emsp;&emsp;In the Ted Talk, Connected but Alone, Sherry Turkle describes how the new advances in technology has altered human prospection both at the individual level as well as a community.  For example, she explains how cellular have such an influential role, that we would sacrifice face to face contact and rather be connected through our gadgets. In the book, The World State wants this to happen in order to create stability. If people are always doing something, especially if that something is lacking thought, then it decreases the chance of Betas and lower to learn because if they know about themselves and who they are in society, stability will be lost.</p>

			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;Brave New World, written by Aldous Huxley, speaks of several different themes. Hierarchy for one is perhaps the most prominent of the majority of those themes, as even from the beginning of the chapter, segregation by rank, as well as discrimination by rank was upheld by the Controllers. However, another theme seen in the beginning is none other than pregnancy substitution. As spoken within the book, "Dr. Wells told me that brunettes with wide pelvises, like me, ought to have their first Pregnancy Substitute at seventeen" (Huxley 44). Now, according to this world, a pregnancy substitute is an intravenous injection that tricks the body into thinking it is pregnant and that balances the hormones. Comparing such a bizarre process to real life does indeed seem rather peculiar in every sense of the word. However, rather than looking at it literally, one must see it from a different perspective. Specifically, the only thing to compare these 'pregnancy substitutes' to is a little concept known as 'synthetic happiness'. The concept of 'synthetic happiness' involves the creation of one's own happiness when the original desire is not fulfilled. In other words, it is best known as 'sugar-coating'. In the words of the speaker who all but advertises the use of synthetic happiness, "We synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found" (Gilbert 3). In other words, we tell ourselves that we are happy with the results of what we have achieved or received until our mind comes to believe that we truly are happy with the results. This sounds rather similar to the pregnancy substitutes found within the book, which, by nearly the same process, tricks the body into believing that it is pregnant, as spoken before. These two are one of many bridges connecting the book's ideals with real life society.</p>

			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;The process of cloning is the key component to this new world. With bokanovsky's scientist are able to produce thousands of clones in a short period of time. With this product one single embryo can be duplicated into many more exactly like it. Some of the benefits of the Bokanovsky process are that people will know their place in society, there is a set design of classes in which everyone is born into. These classes are not brainwashed but engraved into the people's heads that way there is no complications of who is above whom.</p>
