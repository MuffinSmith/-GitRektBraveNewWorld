			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;In these final chapters, the main conflict centers around John, Bernard, and Mustapha Mond. When John is watching the final moments that he can spend with Linda, he is accompanied by a bokanovsky group. John is disgusted by the way they seem happy to watch another living being die. Later, John finds out from the nurse that this practice is called death conditioning, a condition in which young children death as a good thing because after seeing someone die, they are offered treats. John and Mustapha Mond have a hot argument about why the World State has the the customs that its people follow. For example John pleads to Mond about why the State cannot have beauty in the arts nor music. Mustapha explain that it is the price society must pay in order for it to be stable. The lack of advancement in technology, in Mustapha's eyes, is a necessary sacrifice for there to be an utopian world.</p>
			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;In the article, "Technology in the classroom: Is it a good thing?", the author challenges the purpose behind the use of technology in schools. He says "if you're bringing technology into the classroom, there needs to be a real purpose behind it. I question if that purpose is really there."</p>

			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;In this section, it is revealed to us that the science in this Brave New World is not really legitimate science. The Director takes the Savage aside to his office with Bernard and Helmholtz to explain in a narrative the workings of society. Because everything is so carefully and completely organized, it's important that even the 'science' is monitored heavily. What people think is science is really just "a cookery book, with an orthodox theory of cooking that nobody's allowed to question, and a list of recipes that mustn't be added to except by special permission from the head cook." (203) None of the scientists actually have any scientific training, they just do what the director tells them.</p>

			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;How many people have decided to actually go further than the minimum requirement? Is the number too high to count? Or is the number small enough that you can count them on your fingers? If your answer is the former, then that is the closest that you can get to getting a right answer. People these days will never go beyond than what they can do. They settle for achieving what is available in their perspective. In other words, they will only push the boundaries until it meets their satisfaction, wherein they will simply drop all of that progress and just dwindle around that area until their own desire for more self-satisfaction triggers them to push forwards. It has become a rather strange dance of sorts: people will go forward, and then stop. They will go forward... and even further than that... and then stop again. In a physical perspective, it will either look like a poorly generated idea of sneaking up on someone or some sort of strange ritual dance that still looks rather... odd to the naked eye.</p>
			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;In a mental perspective, it becomes an extremely complicated way of trying to determine the extent of one's capabilities. This is because people's idea of self-satisfaction varies from person to person. While one would go down a path and stop at some point when it meets their wants and needs, another will go even further than that to feel a sense of completeness. At some point, a third person will come along and find that that satisfaction will not come about unless they have completely reached the end. Self-satisfaction does not necessarily refer to negativity. People with questions to their own purposes in life will only be further bothered by those very same questions as they continuously seek out self-satisfaction and have achieved a sense of completeness with themselves. To define the term, "Self-satisfaction is a sense of absolute fulfillment with oneself and one's accomplishments" (Farooqi). To gain that sense of fulfillment is the ultimate goal of many nowadays and is brought to light as a rather positive thing. However, through Huxley's novel, gratification of one's appetite for contentment is viewed in a much grimmer light.</p>
			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;Consumerism, that is the immediate desire for a new object or substance as time continues to jump forwards, is the one concept in which the entire World State revolves around in. The creation of new products and such has forced the people of this strange civilization to abandon relics of the past to make way for the technologies of the future. New products go on sale, and very quickly, the substances of old are immediately forgotten, as if they had never even existed in the first place. Mustapha Mond explains his reasoning for allowing this system to continue in society: "People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can't get" (198). With all of everyone's needs and wants having been satisfied, there is no room for complaint whatsoever. They feel fulfilled. They don't want to complain, simply because they can't. They have no reason to do so... and how could they? Everything has been handed to them. Mond's words aren't too far off the mark. Everyone's gotten what they wanted, and needed for that matter, leaving no room for complaint.</p>
			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;And thus, their people have degenerated into infants.</p>
			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;The idea of growing up is a concept that a good majority of people, if not everyone, is familiar with. The change from a child, to a teenager, to a budding adult is a process that young people are quite fond of, as it allows others to be able to acknowledge their presence, something that would not have been possible beforehand. Calling someone a child is the same as actually referring to them as an inferior individual. Because one has grown up and become a full-fledged adult, many privileges have become available to them. On the other hand, some privileges available to them as children may not actually be accessible after their age has caught up to them, both physical and mental. Now, if it were physical, the logic put behind it is reasonable, such as squeezing through small openings in the backyard. However, the mental reasons are what make it complicated.
			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;Having grown up, one's physical capabilities are usually enhanced, especially if they have trained their body to do so. Small things like lifting 'heavy' bags of groceries or even tossing a ball have become far too easy for an adult to do. If you were to ask them to play a small game, though, you would find them so easily shaking their head. Their having 'matured' disallows them from participating in small menial activities that would normally have placed a smile on their faces some few years ago. They have grown up, and believe that such tasks are for 'children' and 'people who have yet to grow up'. What is deemed to be fun by one generation is seen as childish and immature by another generation. One believes one is superior, the other remains blissfully unaware, lost in the clouds of enjoyment.</p>
			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;This goes both ways. The younger generation does not necessarily have to like growing up. If anything, they could just as easily be content with their current and daily lives without ever having to change a thing. That is contentment. They would loathe the older generation for not understanding what it means to remain a child. Or rather, they associate 'child' with a nicer word of 'youth'. Youth is a nicer word. The word itself alludes to quirkiness, spirit, and a carefree attitude. Youth, however, is regarded as negative by Huxley. Brave New World mentions youth as a symbol of denying change, and accepting just enough for satisfaction, never more. Once again, Mond mentions this with his own words: "...they're blissfully ignorant of passion and old age..." (198). They have kept the same thing consistent, satisfying themselves, never aiming for higher, always staying the same. Change is nonexistent. Youth is forever. That is their symbol.</p>

			    			<p>&emsp;&emsp;Bernard and Helmholtz are some of the few people to be exiled from the brave new world, Mond himself even says that the islands is a better place for them as they are not like the others. The people on the islands are some of the most interesting people because none of them could fit in. Reach out and be different and maybe you'll be exiled and get to live a lifetime of freedom and true happiness.</p>
